# Intellagent

Intellagent is a cloud-based help desk software solution for small business, powered by AI and machine learning. It integrates with
Twitter and features automatic triage of customer complaints using text classification techniques â€” connecting the customer
to the correct agent according to the agent's skillset and nature of the complaint. Intellagent is the result of my fourth
year independent research project for my BSc in Creative Computing at the [Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology.](https://iadt.ie/)
This project gave me the opportunity to use new technologies and experiment with machine learning and AI.
